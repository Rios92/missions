The following is not allowed, read strictly forbidden!<br/><br/>
Uploading Domination to Steam Workshop is not allowed (only by myself)!!!!!<br/><br/>
You are not allowed to monetize videos recorded/streamed while playing Domination in any form!!!!<br/>
(Non-commercial license, that's for you, youtube and twitch heroes. Make your own content if you want to make money and don't use other peoples work!!!)<br/><br/>
Server owners are also not allowed to monetize their servers with perks or anything else when using/playing Domination!<br/>
(Again, non-commercial license!)<br/><br/>
Additionally you are not allowed to use any of the Dom scripts/dialogs/images/whatever outside of the mission!<br/>
This is strictly forbidden! Removing the ingame messages about monetization is also not allowed!!!<br/><br/>
It is also strictly forbidden for server host companys to sell or rent servers with the mission!!<br/>
(Non commercial license, not that hard to understand)<br/><br/>
THIS MISSION IS Arma 3 only! Because no derivates are allowed it also means no port to any other game in the series is allowed!<br/><br/>
PLEASE ALSO TRY TO NOT USE ANY DLC CONTENT WHICH IS RESTRICTED TO DLC OWNERS ONLY. THIS ONLY FRUSTRATS PLAYERS WHO DO NOT OWN THE DLC!!!!<br/><br/>
You are free to edit the mission for your own server but you may not release the mission elsewhere (read the license!).<br/>
Furthermore you may not use servside addons with code from the mission or from your modded version. All code has to be in the mission.pbo!
